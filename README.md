## Concept

What should I watch?!

As a team, we wanted to create a website for users to search for movies and save their top five favorites. By using two movie APIs to fetch information including title, poster, year, ID, and synopsis, Movie Night is a one stop shop for all things movie information.

## Process

Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- APIs
- JSON

Tasks & Roles:

- HTML & CSS: Jane
- JavaScript APIs: Chao
- JavaScript Local Storage: Jessica
- README: Jessica
- Presentation:

Challenges:

- Streamlining project idea and keeping it in scope
- Determining how to divide up the work
- Finding APIs to fully work with our concept
- Getting user saved movie IDs to display

Successes:

- Working with a team for the first time
- Completing the project

## Future Direction

- Implement a section to display if the selected movie is available to stream and on what specific streaming services
- Work through bugs in the API itself
